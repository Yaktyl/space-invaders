# space-invaders

Intermediate/Advanced learning project to make Space Invaders using Python turtle.

In this project, you will learn how to use turtle graphics to create the game Space Invaders. You will learn how to manage and coordinate multiple sprites in a mainloop, do collision detection, and bind commands to key events.  This project uses Python 3.

## Difficulty Level:  INTERMEDIATE/ADVANCED

To understand this project, you should have experience with basic Python: variables, functions, loops, conditionals, randomness, and other foundational concepts. It also helps to have an understanding of the mathematical cartesian coordinate system.
